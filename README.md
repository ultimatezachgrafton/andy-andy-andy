<b>Summary</b><br>
My mission here was to learn how to create a rock-paper-scissors app. I utilized the likeness of friend and mentor Andy to make it stand out and seized the opportunity to learn some new CSS functionality, such as making the Andys float independently. Creating the functionality of the different win-scenarios without writing out each possible result was another interesting challenge.
